To run locally, you can use `npm run start`.

Please be aware of the fact that this app will not work on browsers that have chosen not to support the WebHID API (notably Firefox). You can check for compatibility [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API#browser_compatibility).
