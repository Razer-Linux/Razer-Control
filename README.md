# Razer Control

This webapp allows users to edit hardware settings for Razer gaming laptops in Linux using the [WebHID API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API). 

### Contributing

To run locally, you can use `npm run start`.

Please be aware of the fact that this app will not work on browsers that have chosen not to support the WebHID API (notably Firefox). You can check for compatibility [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API#browser_compatibility).
